# Pop Balls

I wanted to try and work on a simulation with Mechanics. This game has blobs moving around with Physics mechanics and each time you click on a blob, u destroy it and get points. Once u destroy all the blobs, u move on to the next level. Try it out [here](https://mohammed-shoaib.github.io/Watch-Me-Build/Projects/Pop%20Balls/)!
